# Task 
This is an advancement of the previous project. 
[ project1AWSwordCount](https://github.com/CyrusNchege/AWS-devops-100-day-challenge/tree/main/project1AWSwordCount)

The project is to create a lambda function that will be triggered by an S3 bucket. The lambda function will read the contents of the file and count the number of words in the file. The lambda function will then send an email to the user with the number of words in the file.

I will include Writer User Interface to upload the file to the S3 bucket. The user will then receive an email with the number of words in the file.

 (For this project I will use Django and host it on Elastic Beanstalk.)
